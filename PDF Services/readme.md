#### Save PDF to Web Receipts Folder v2
Ever find yourself needing to organize your digital receipts? Well here's the tool for you. Go to print off a receipt as normal, but then in the bottom-left corner of macOS's Print dialog, select this in the PDF menu. It'll ask for the date and verify that what it got for a default filename is OK with you, then save the PDF file to `~/Documents/Web Receipts/` with the filename pattern `YYYYMMDD <name>.pdf`.
