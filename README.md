# A macOS Automation Repository
A repo for all the things I wrote/stole to make my life a little easier. Enjoy.

**How to Install:** Most of these are just `.zip` files containing Automator workflows, in which case just download and extract the appropriate `.zip` file, then simply open the file inside and macOS will take it from there.

If installation instructions differ from the above, it'll be noted in the small text under the header.
