A repo for all the things I wrote/stole to make my life a little easier. Enjoy.

Most of these are just `.zip` files containing Automator workflows, in which case just download and extract the appropriate `.zip` file, then open the file inside and macOS will take it from there. If installation instructions differ, it'll be noted in the folder's readme.

Descriptions for the automations can be found in the appropriate folder's readme, so click on a folder to get started I guess
