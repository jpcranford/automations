# A macOS Automation Repository
A repo for all the things I wrote/stole to make my life a little easier. Enjoy.

**How to Install:** Most of these are just Automator workflows. Download and open to install. (Be careful though, GitHub likes to treat them as empty folders, but you need the whole thing.)

If installation instructions differ from the above, it'll be noted in the folder's readme.
